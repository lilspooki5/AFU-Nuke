## üß© About

**AFU Nuker v1** is a Discord nuker bot built using `discord.py`. It performs destructive actions on a server (with permission), such as:
- Renaming the server
- Deleting all channels and roles
- Banning all members
- Spamming new channels and roles
- Sending spam messages via **webhooks**

Originally made for educational and stress-testing purposes, this bot demonstrates how automation and webhooks can interact with Discord‚Äôs server structure.
